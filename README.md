## How to connect Linshare to Inbox using JWT

From the Administration Center/JWT (platform administration mode), you can generate a public key.

> - OpenPaaS generate PEM format

This key must be stored in LinShare with the good issuer. 

> - LinShare supports two public keys formats : SSH and PEM. 

For that you can use this CURL with the public key generated by OpenPaaS:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  http://0.0.0.0:30000/linshare/webservice/rest/admin/public_keys -u "ADMIN_USERNAME:PASSWORD"  -d '{
    "domainUuid" : "LinShareRootDomain",
    "issuer" : "linagora.esn.linshare",
    "publicKey" : " ",
    "format" : "PEM"
}'
```

> **PS**  You need to use ``` \n ``` to attach the lines of the public key in the PEM format.


**To test the connector u need to have the same user in the two domains of OpenPaaS and LinShare.**
